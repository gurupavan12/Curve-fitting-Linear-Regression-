If new dataset is required, then use the generateData.m and generateData200.m to get data.mat for 50 and 200 points dataset. 
Else with the data.mat in the current working directory as that of the other matlab files, you can run the code with the data.mat that I've used. 
If the entire code with all the plots and figures are required, then run

- main.m file. With every part that finishes, the figure window closes and the plots can be observed in the working directory.


If only the 50 data points is required, then run curvefit.m
